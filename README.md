## Abstract
This CIP proposes a metadata standard for recording water allocation and usage data on the Cardano blockchain. The schema enables consistent representation of information such as water rights, allocations, withdrawals, and consumption events. By standardizing how this data is published in transaction metadata, the proposal ensures interoperability between different applications, explorers, and compliance systems. The format is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and compatible with existing Cardano metadata practices. Its primary


## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?
Current systems for tracking water allocation and usage are fragmented, inconsistent, and often siloed across jurisdictions and organizations. On Cardano, while transaction metadata can already encode arbitrary information, there is no standardized approach for representing water-related records. This lack of standardization makes it difficult for stakeholders to interpret or integrate water usage data across dApps, explorers, and compliance systems.

A shared metadata schema would enable:
- Governments and regulators to audit water allocations against usage in near real time.
- Enterprises and utilities to demonstrate responsible water use and reporting.
- dApps and sustainability platforms to integrate water data into broader ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting frameworks.
- Communities and researchers to transparently access water use records in a verifiable, tamper-resistant format.

By creating a common standard, this CIP reduces duplication of effort, improves data interoperability, and provides a foundation for scalable, blockchain-based water resource management.

## Specification
<!-- The technical specification should describe the proposed improvement in sufficient technical detail. In particular, it should provide enough information that an implementation can be performed solely on the basis of the design in the CIP. This is necessary to facilitate multiple, interoperable implementations. This must include how the CIP should be versioned, if not covered under an optional Versioning main heading. If a proposal defines structure of on-chain data it must include a CDDL schema in its specification.-->

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?
<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and what led to particular design decisions. It should describe alternate designs considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss significant objections or concerns raised during the discussion.

It must also explain how the proposal affects the backward compatibility of existing solutions when applicable. If the proposal responds to a CPS, the 'Rationale' section should explain how it addresses the CPS, and answer any questions that the CPS poses for potential solutions.
